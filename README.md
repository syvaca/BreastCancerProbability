## Introduction
Implementing **Naive Bayes** on a Breast Cancer data set. The algorithm uses a provided training set. Estimate posterior probabilities using training data.

Have to clean the data found in the [`data.npy`](./data.npy).

The utility file has functions provided that will compute the `load_data`.
It also contains the names of the features in the dataset in the order that they appear in the columns.


## Test File:
The test file will try to use the `preprocess_data`, `naive_bayes`and`cross_validation`.

The test file uses `load_data` to pull a tuple from the data.
